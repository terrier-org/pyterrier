Query Rewriting & Expansion
---------------------------

Query rewriting refers to changing the formulation of the query in order to improve the effectiveness of the
search ranking. PyTerrier supplies a number of query rewriting transformers designed to work with BatchRetrieve.

Firstly, we differentiate between two forms of query rewriting:

 - `Q -> Q`: this rewrites the query, for instance by adding/removing extra query terms. Examples might 
   be a WordNet- or Word2Vec-based query expansion, or proximity query rewriting, such as the sequential
   dependence model. In this form, the input dataframes contain only `["qid", "docno"]` columns and
   similarly, the output dataframes contain only `["qid", "docno"]` columns.

 - `R -> Q`: these class of transformers rewrite a query by making use of an associated set of documents
   for each query. This is exemplifed by pseudo-relevance feedback, where expansion terms are identified
   from the retrieved documents of each query.

SequentialDependence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class implements Metzler and Croft's sequential dependence model, designed to boost the scores of
documents where the query terms occur in close proximity. Application of this transformer rewrites 
each input query such that:

 - pairs of adjacent query terms are added as `#1` and `#uw8` complex query terms, with a low weight.
 - the full query is added as `#uw12` complex query term, with a low weight.
 - all terms are weighted by a proximity model, either Dirichlet LM or pBiL2.

For example, the query `pyterrier IR platform` would become `pyterrier IR platform #1(pyterrier IR) #1(IR platform) #uw8(pyterrier IR) #uw8(IR platform) #uw12(pyterrier IR platform)`.
NB: Acutally, we have simplified the rewritten query - in practice, we also (a) set the weight of the proximity terms to be low using a `#combine()`
operator and (b) set a proximity term weighting model.

This transfomer is only compatible with BatchRetrieve, as Terrier supports the `#1` and `#uwN` complex query terms operators. The Terrier index must have blocks (positional information) recorded in the index.

.. autoclass:: pyterrier.rewrite.SequentialDependence
    :members: transform

Example::

    sdm = pt.rewrite.SequentialDependence()
    dph = pt.BatchRetrieve(index, wmodel="DPH")
    pipeline = sdm >> dph

Bo1QueryExpansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This class applies the Bo1 Divergence from Randomess query expansion model to rewrite the
query based on the occurences of terms in the feedback documents provided for each
query. In this way, it takes in a dataframe with columns `["qid", "query", "docno", "score", "rank"]`
and returns a dataframe with  `["qid", "query"]`.

.. autoclass:: pyterrier.rewrite.Bo1QueryExpansion
    :members: transform 

Example::

    bo1 = pt.rewrite.Bo1QueryExpansion(index)
    dph = pt.BatchRetrieve(index, wmodel="DPH")
    pipelineQE = dph >> bo1 >> dph

**Alternative Formulations**

Note that it is also possible to configure BatchRetrieve to perform QE directly using controls,
which will result in identical retrieval effectiveness::

    pipelineQE = pt.BatchRetrieve(index, wmodel="DPH", controls={"qemodel" : "Bo1", "qe" : "on"})

However, using `pt.rewrite.Bo1QueryExpansion` is preferable as:

 - the semantics of retrieve >> rewrite >> retrieve are clearly visible.
 - the complex control configuration of Terrier need not be learned. 
 - the rewritten query is visible outside, and not hidden inside Terrier.

KLQueryExpansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Bo1, this class deploys a Divergence from Randomess query expansion model based on Kullback Leibler divergence.
