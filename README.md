# PyTerrier

A Python API for Terrier

# Installation

The easiest way to get started with PyTerrier is to use one of our Colab notebooks - look for the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) badges below.

### Linux or Google Colab
1. `pip install python-terrier`
2. You may need to set JAVA_HOME environment variable if Pyjnius cannot find your Java installation.

### macOS

1. You need to hava Java installed. Pyjnius/PyTerrier will pick up the location automatically.
2. `pip install python-terrier`

### Windows
PyTerrier is not available for Windows because [pytrec_eval](https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval) [isn't available for Windows](https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval/issues/19). If you can compile & install pytrec_eval youself, it should work fine.

# Indexing

PyTerrier has a number of useful classes for creating indices:

 - You can create an index from TREC formatted collection using TRECCollectionIndexer.    
 - For TXT, PDF, Microsoft Word files, etc files you can use FilesIndexer.
 - For Pandas Dataframe you can use DFIndexer.
 - For any abitrary iterable dictionaries, you can use IterDictIndexer.

See the [indexing documentation](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terrier-indexing.html), or the examples in the [indexing notebook](examples/notebooks/indexing.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/terrier-org/pyterrier/blob/master/examples/notebooks/indexing.ipynb)

# Retrieval and Evaluation

```python
topics = pt.io.read_topics(topicsFile)
qrels = pt.io.read_qrels(qrelsFile)
BM25_br = pt.BatchRetrieve(index, wmodel="BM25")
res = BM25_br.transform(topics)
pt.Utils.evaluate(res, qrels, metrics = ['map'])
```

See also the [retrieval documentation](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terrier-retrieval.html), or the worked example in the [retrieval and evaluation notebook](examples/notebooks/retrieval_and_evaluation.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/terrier-org/pyterrier/blob/master/examples/notebooks/retrieval_and_evaluation.ipynb)

# Experiment - Perform Retrieval and Evaluation with a single function
PyTerrier provides an [Experiment](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/experiments.html) function, which allows to compare multiple retrieval approaches on the same queries & relevance assessments:

```python
pt.Experiment([BM25_br, PL2_br], topics, qrels, ["map", "ndcg"])
```

There is a worked example in the [experiment notebook](examples/notebooks/experiment.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/terrier-org/pyterrier/blob/master/examples/notebooks/experiment.ipynb)

# Pipelines

Pyterrier makes it easy to develop complex retrieval pipelines using Python operators such as `>>` to chain different retrieval components. Each retrieval approach is a [transformer](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transformer.html), having one key method, `transform()`, which takes a single Pandas dataframe as input, and returns another dataframe. Two examples might encapsulate applying the sequential dependence model, or a query expansion process:
```python
sdm_bm25 = pt.rewrite.SDM() >> pt.BatchRetrieve(indexref, wmodel="BM25")
bo1_qe = BM25_br >> pt.rewrite.Bo1QueryExpansion() >> BM25_br
```

There is documentation on [transformer operators](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators.html) as well as  [example pipelines](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeline_examples.html) show other common use cases. For more information, see the [PyTerrier data model](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datamodel.html).

# Learning to Rank

Complex learning to rank pipelines, including for learning-to-rank, can be constructed using PyTerrier's operator language. For example, to combine two features and make them available for learning, we can use the `**` operator.
```python
two_features = BM25_br >> ( \
  pt.BatchRetrieve(indexref, wmodel="DirichletLM") ** 
  pt.BatchRetrieve(indexref, wmodel="PL2") \
 )
```

See also the [learning to rank documentation](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ltr.html), as well as the worked examples in the [learning-to-rank notebook](examples/notebooks/ltr.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/terrier-org/pyterrier/blob/master/examples/notebooks/ltr.ipynb). Some pipelines can be automatically optimised - more detail about pipeline optimisation are included in our ICTIR 2020 paper.

# Dataset API

PyTerrier allows simple access to standard information retrieval test collections through its [dataset API](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets.html), which can download the topics, qrels, corpus or, for some test collections, a ready-made Terrier index.

```python
topics = pt.datasets.get_dataset("trec-robust-2004").get_topics()
qrels = pt.datasets.get_dataset("trec-robust-2004").get_qrels()
pt.Experiment([BM25_br, PL2_br], topics, qrels, eval_metrics)
```

You can index datasets that include a corpus using IterDictIndexer and get_corpus_iter:

```python
dataset = pt.datasets.get_dataset('irds:cord19/trec-covid')
indexer = pt.index.IterDictIndexer('./cord19-index')
index_ref = indexer.index(dataset.get_corpus_iter(), fields=('title', 'abstract'))
```

You can use `pt.datasets.list_datasets()` to see available test collections - if your favourite test collection is missing, [you can submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier/pulls).

All datasets from the [ir_datasets package](https://github.com/allenai/ir_datasets) are available
under the `irds:` prefix. E.g., use `pt.datasets.get_dataset("irds:medline/2004/trec-genomics-2004")`
to get the TREC Genomics 2004 dataset. A full catalogue of ir_datasets is available [here](https://ir-datasets.com/all.html).

# Index API

All of the standard Terrier Index API can be access easily from Pyterrier. 

For instance, accessing term statistics is a single call on an index:
```python
index.getLexicon()["circuit"].getDocumentFrequency()
```

There are lots of examples in the [index API notebook](examples/notebooks/index_api.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/terrier-org/pyterrier/blob/master/examples/notebooks/index_api.ipynb)
