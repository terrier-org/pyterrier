the argus experiment  a geophysical experiment on global scale was
conducted last fall  three small abombs were detonated beyond the
atmosphere at a location in the south atlantic  the purpose of the
experiment was to study the trapping of the relativistic electrons
produced by the decay fission fragments in the geomagnetic field
the released electrons are trapped by this field oscillating along
the magnetic lines between two mirror points  in addition to this
motion the electrons drift eastward creating a thin electron shell
around the earth  the lifetime and location of the thus created global
electron shell were measured by satellite and rocket borne instruments
auroral luminescence was observed at the conjugate points  the electron
shell exhibited remarkable stability during its lifetime  no motion
of the shell or change in its thickness was detected

abnormal ionization in the lower ionosphere associated with cosmic
ray flux enhancements  two separate abnormalities in ionization were
recognizable during the great solar event of february the early effects
observed at the time of the sudden cosmic ray enhancement and the
late effects which reached a maximum an appreciable time later  a
difference in composition between streams of solar particles of cosmic
ray energies and ordinary cosmic rays is postulated to explain the
former effect while the latter is explained in terms of ionization
at heights of km produced by the passage or stopping of solar particles
predominantly protons  the absence of auroral and magnetic effects

the very low frequency emissions generated in the earths exosphere
types of noise other than whistlers have been examined using high

the reflexion of radio waves from a stratified ionosphere modified
by weak irregularities  consideration is given to the scattered wave
which accompanies reflexion from a stratified ionosphere in which
there are weak irregularities  by considering these irregularities
to be confined to a thin layer near a given height the possibility
is examined that they might produce considerably enhanced scattering
if they were situated near the reflexion level calculated on the
basis of geometrical optics  it is found that they would not have
a very much greater effect at this level  it is also shown that if
the electron collision frequency is of the order likely to be encountered
in the real ionosphere there would be little enhancement by resonance

to explain the observed features of scintillations and spread f

the origin of the ionospheric irregularities responsible for radio
star scintillations and spread f part  a theory is presented which
attributes the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities in the f
region to turbulent wind motion in the dynamo region at a height
of km  the resulting turbulent component of the electric potential
field produced is communicated to the f region as suggested by martyn
where magneto electric forces then cause the ionization to form eddies
it is suggested that the absence of daytime scintillations is due
to the inhibition of turbulent flow by large temperature gradients
during the day  the theory is then shown to explain the major features
of radio star scintillations together with the long term correlation
of scintillation amplitude with magnetic activity and the variation
of spread f and scintillations at different parts of the earth over

the effect of diffusion on the vertical distribution of ionization
in a quiet f region  electrons are assumed to disappear by attachment
to neutral molecules and by diffusion  the coefficient of attachment
is assumed to be constant while the diffusion constant is calculated
according to classical theory  using rocket measurements of air density
and temperature the vertical distribution of electrons can be calculated
the results are at variance with those actually observed possibly
because the diffusion constant is much less than that assumed

geomagnetic disturbances associated with solar flares with major
premaximum bursts at radio frequencies mc  a close association is
found between solar flares in the early phase of which radio noise
at frequencies is received and sudden commencement ionospheric storms
on the earth  it is suggested that this rf emission may be from the
suns outer atmosphere and corona and thus may indicate which solar
flares are accompanied by the ejection of storm producing particles
although flare data are incomplete the proportion of flares having
major early bursts is estimated at and the number of flares is comparable
to the number of ionospheric storms not identifiable with well
established day recurrent series  an average time delay of days occurs
between flare and geomagnetic disturbance and the intensity of the
disturbance is related to the position of the flare on the suns disk

the variation of decimetre wave radiation with solar activity  a
statistical method is used to segregate the quiet component from
the slowly varing component of solar decimetre wave radiation in
the period  for this purpose the radiations at frequencies and have
been correlated with sunspot numbers sunspot areas and faculae  the
mean lives of the various radiations and activities have been estimated
and compared  there is an increase of life with decreasing radio
frequency  the life of radiation is about the same as sunspots but
measurements of the latter show some anomalies  the slowly varying
radiation flux is proportional to frequency in the range studied
the quiet sun flux has a small but significant variation with solar
activity the relative change being greater for smaller frequencies
the possibility that this variation may be associated with uncorrelated
local sources such as prominences is not entirely excluded

clouds are intermittently ejected from the sun and slowed down by

stability of oscillation in valve generators  a comprehensive theory
of stabilitys is developed which is applicable to a large class of
harmonic oscillators  the paper is concerned mainly with the terminal
regenerative type of oscillator with grid leak bias but the analysis
applies also to circuits with fixed grid bias and to terminal oscillators
all known forms of instability appear as special cases of the
general theory and some new forms are predicted  stability is determined
by the nature of the roots of a characteristic equation and stability
criteria are obtained in the form of inequalities between the parameters
of the amplifier and feedback network  a modified form of nyquist
locus diagram can also be used  when the feedback network is symmetrical
with respect to the oscillation frequency the characteristic equation
can be factorized to give independent criteria for frequency and
amplitude stability  hysteresis effects and periodic instability
are analysed in detail  in addition to the general treatment specific
forms of the various parameters which appear in the stability criteria
are worked out for a three halves law amplifier with a semi linear
or exponential grid current characteristic  quantitative experimental
confirmation is provided

frequency gyrofrequency and modulation frequency  the term self interaction
is preferred to self demodulation since the modulation depth

the specification of the properties of the thermistor as a circuit
element in very low frequency systems  an analysis based on sinusoidal
applied voltages shows that a conductor whose resistance is a function
of temperature may be represented by an equivalent circuit having
a semicircular impedance locus  an expression for the distortion
of the waveform is also obtained and this is found to be small provided
that the alternating current is less than a quarter of t steady polarizing
current which flows in the conductor  the impedance loci of
a bead type thermistor are plotted by means of null technique  a
typical impedance varied from a negative resistance of at very low

that a region with arbitrary height distribution of ionization will
by diffusion assume the form of a chapman region after a time which

accurate height measurements using an ionospheric recorder  a method

corrects errors in height measurement arising from the distortion
of the echo pulse in its passage through the receiver  the amount
of this error depends on the echo amplitude and is shown to vary
in an approximately linear manner with the width of the recorded
echo trace  several methods of checking the calibration confirm that
it is reliable to within  using a calibrated recorder and an expanded
timebase it is possible to measure region equivalent heights to this
order of accuracy  the systematic error due to pulse distortion will
in general cause the heights recorded in routine ionospheric measurements

study of the ionospheric d region using partial reflections  pulse
echo observations were made with a transmitter of peak power and
with the receiver located where the noise level was very low  results
showed that below the e layer there were two reflection regions a
region of greater electron density around extending up to the normal
e layer and having minimum ionization at noon a region around km
where a distinct ionized layer forms during the day attains a maximum
ionization at noon and disappears at night  in echoes from this region
both magneto ionic components were present the extraordinary being
the stronger  the ratio of the two magneto ionic components of a
discrete echo at a particular range was within the uncertainty of
observation independent of fading but varied with time of day and
from day to day  from this ratio the collision frequency and electron
density for this range of heights were determined

some statistical results on the phenomena associated with ionospheric
storms  data covering the years on height of maximum ionization o
of the f layer and absorption in lower layers were analysed to determine
the probability that a particular day will be a storm day for a given
set of solar conditions  a day is considered to b be a storm day
if the mean variation of these three parameters studied separately
in relation to the effects of sunspots m regions and solar flares
is such as would cause a fall in muf or a rise in luf  positive results
were obtained only for the parameter f  except for storms associated
with m regions at sunspot minimum the probability that a given day
will be a storm day does not exceed for the first day of a storm
but many reach on subsequent days  it is concluded that only during
the sunspot minimum period can ionospheric storms be forecast on
solar data alone

a reference system based on the principal directions of the three
dimensional dielectric ellipsoid these depend only on the direction
of the earths field and are essentially constant over the ionosphere
optic axes can exist in the ionosphere in the presence of collisions
and this is precisely the condition for critical coupling between
the ordinary and extraordinary modes  the analysis is illustrated

electrical properties of the blizzard  the programme of the expedition

the interference with radio reception due to this cause was found
to be so bad that an investigation was instituted  when a meter was
connected between the aerial feeder of the atmospherics receiver
and earth a current of was observed varying with the intensity of
the wind some days later in identical weather conditions the same
current intensities were measured but with reversed sign  to explain
this result extended measurements were made of the charge collected
using horizontal aerials arranged at right angles to the wind the
rf noise spectrum of the blizzard was also studied using a receiver
with a frequency range of  records were also made of reception of
wwv and wwvh on and for correlation with anemometer and charge records
the results indicate that the sign of the charge collected depends

ionization distribution in the f region  the height distribution
of ionization in the composite f region is calculated on the assumptions
that the scale height ie the temperature increases and the recombination
coefficient decreases with height in this region  the recombination
coefficient is assumed to vary in terms of the reduced height that
is the height above f max measured in terms of the actual height
as had been done earlier by ap mitra in making similar calculations
the present assumption automatically takes into account the effect
of rising temperature on the value of the recombination coefficient
height distribution curves for high and low latitude stations are
drawn for typical summer and winter conditions in the high atmosphere
in the f region  when the possible effect of ionospheric tidal drifts
are taken into account the forms of the distribution curves and the
separation between the f and f layers agree with those deduced from
observations  the results support the view that the f and f layers
belong to a common bank of ionization produced by solar radiation

with height  the systematic movements have the form of regular diurnal
and seasonal variations and show considerable consistency between
observations made in the northern and southern hemispheres  at heights

vector the direction of the rotation is clockwise in the northern
hemisphere and anti clockwise in the southern hemisphere  this is

the synthesis of a network to have a sine squared impulse response
the method of moments of the mean moment type used by moss is applied
to the problem of designing a network with an impulse response of
prescribed form  the method is not applicable in all cases but is
particularly suitable for the design of a low pass system with not
too sharp a cut off and not too oscillatory an impulse response
calculation for the case of the sine squared pulse results in design
data for a ladder network of inductors and capacitors with resistive
terminations  the discrepancy between the impulse response curve
and the exact sine square curve at no point exceeds of the peak amplitude
of the pulse

the transient response of rf and if filters to a wave packet  summary
only  analysis based on fourier integral transforms is applied to
two particular circuits a single stage of tuned anode coupling a
single stage of tuned transformer coupling  the analysis is valid
for circuits of any bandwidth  particular attention is paid to the
build up time of a transient which for a band pass network is usually
assumed to be inversely proportional to the network bandwidth  the
analysis shows that this assumption is correct for the tuned anode
coupling circuit if the ratio of the half bandwidth to the resonance
frequency is less than unity  for the tuned transformer circuit however
the rule does not hold good since for a given bandwidth there are
many possible transfer impedances and hence transient responses
the rule should therefore only be applied to circuits which its application
is shown to be legitimate

the effect of noise on the frequency stability of a linear oscillator
the standard conditions for a sinusoidal oscillation are that the
attenuation and net phase shift around the closed loop be zero  random
fluctuations are relied upon to start the oscillation  if the level
of oscillation is to remain finite in the continued presence of noise
the oscillating loop must hav  some attenuation and functions like
a highly regenerative amplifier with a loop gain very nearly unity
accordingly the oscillator produces not a single frequency but rather
a narrow band of noise that causes instability in the magnitude and
in the apparent frequency of the output  thes instabilities are discussed
for oscillators in which all elements are linear except for some
slow acting amplitude control  the bandwidth of the noisy oscillation
can be predicted from easily measured system characteristics  several
methods of defining the frequency of the output are considered with
special reference to precision measurements  in general the measured
frequency departs from the zero phase shift criterion and is dependent
on the measuring equipment  methods of minimizing instabilities due
to noise are investigated

on an equation connected with the theory of triode oscillations
detailed discussion of the periodic solutions of the differential

theory of triode oscillations has been built up for this case  in
practice however  the graph of has a much flatter bottom than that
of the function and cartwright of and of has raised the question
whether this flattening will alter the performance of the circuit
near resonance  the main part of this paper is an attempt to answer
this question  an estimate is made of the permissible degree of flattening
of the curve without the detuning diagram losing any of its significant
properties  various pertinent theorems are established and the
possible periodic solutions of the equation are discussed in relation
to the detuning diagram  particular results include the following
a if k is small enough and the value of lies in a certain small range
near forced oscillations with half the applied frequency are possible
two of these have amplitudes very large compared with that of the

is its consideration of saturation and transient performance in addition
to the usual steady state behaviour  this theory is essentially an
extension of the researches of wiener and lee in statistical methods
for filter design  saturation is handled by limiting the rms signal
levels at critical points in the linear model used as the design
basis for the physical system  transient performance is handled by
limiting the integral square errors to a set of transient test signals

conductivity of the ionosphere  the investigations of various workers
relative to balfour stewarts dynamo theory of geomagnetic diurnal
variations are reviewed and the fundamental principles involved in
the production of electric currents in the ionosphere by tidal winds
are reexamined  three conductivities two of which are related to
the hall effect appear to be involved  one of these has two relatively
small maxima at km height due mainly to ions and due to electrons
the second has a broad maximum at thus including all the e region
ionization and the third has a very pronounced sharp maximum at km
discussion shows that the effective conductivity of the ionosphere
over most of the earth is some twelve times greater than that deduced
when the hall current is ignored and near the magnetic equator the
conductivity is increased further by a factor of  equations developed
appear to account quantitatively for the high conductivity required
by the dynamo theory and also for the increased conductivity near
the magnetic equator  near the equator the current system should
be in a relatively thin layer centred at about km height  evidence

travelling through a medium with a velocity greater than that of
light  the essential results of frank and tamms theory of the effect
are quoted and references given to accounts of experimental verifications
of the theory using electrons and also protons  the possibility
of producing em waves in he range between the far infra red and uhf

action of an unlimited train of telegraphic signals on a resonant
rlc circuit  the response of a series rlc circuit to a train of pulse
signals is considered for three types of pulse rectangular symmetrical
trapezoidal and of sine squared form  analysis shows that in the
steady state whatever the degree of mistuning of the circuit with
respect to the signal hf the amplitude of the current varies continually
with time  the variations are due partly to energy dissipation during
the intervals between the signals and partly to beating of the forced
oscillations due to the signals with the natural oscillations of
the circuit  the latter effect is particularly noticeable in a very
selective circuit but its magnitude is largely dependent on the degree
of mistuning of the circuit  see also of

effects of solar flares on the absorption of cosmic noise  abnormal
variations of ionospheric absorption were investigated during the

observations of the increases in absorption during the resulting
sudden ionospheric disturbances are compared with observations of
sudden phase anomalies in waves rn waves reflected from the ionosphere
a db absorption difference appears to correspond to a phase anomaly
of about at the frequency considered  as a method of detecting sudden
ionospheric disturbances observation of the absorption variation
variation is as sensitive as and more convenient than observation
of phase anomalies  evidence was found of a delayed increase of absorption
about hours after some solar flares the magnetic records sshowed
no abnormal features at these times and it is uncertain whether the

an effective length to replace the actual length of the rod
for a given temperature at the centre the relaxation time varies

nature of ball lightning  energy considerations indicate that ball
lightning can be sustained neither by a chemical process nor by a
nuclear process  it is suggested that the luminous ball could be
produced in a weakly ionized gas by a resonance process the energy
required to increase the ionization and then to maintain it inside
a sphere of diameter d being supplied by rf waves with d  the centre
of the sphere would coincide with a maximum of the wave interference
field  the rf waves could be due to an oscillatory process in the
ionized atmosphere excited by a lightning discharge  the proposed
mechanism also explains bead lightning the absence of influence of
wind on the position of the luminous ball and the waveguide effect
of chimneys  explosive and quiet types of decay are associated respectively
with rapid and slow changes in the rf field strength at the
end of the phenomenon  observations in the decimetre region during

lightning are suggested

notes on the theory of magnetic storms  a non mathematical account
is given of the model problems and their solutions by which chapman
and ferraro have sought to illustrate some aspects of the theory
of magnetic storms  these problems are here used to develop a qualitative
solution of the motition of an infinite neutral ionized plane
sheet of gas or of a succession of such sheets towards a unidirectional
magnetic field whose intensity decreases as an inverse power of the
distance from an axis to which the sheet is parallel  the gas in
the centre approaches to a minimum distance from the axis and then
recedes again  the gas far to either side moves onward with little
distortion  between these central and outer parts there are two strips
of the sheet whose ions and electrons separate from each other under
the influence of the magnetic field partly because these strips become
much extended and reduced to low density  some charges are deviated
away to infinity others are captured by the field and build up a
westward electric current to which is ascribed the main phase of
a magnetic storms

the f layer at sunrise  observations at cambridge and slough show
that at fixed heights in the f region just after layer sunrise the
electron density increases faster in winter than in summer and faster
at sunspot maximum than at sunspot minimum  it is postulated that
seasonal changes of atmospheric composition alter the rates of electron
production and loss thereby causing both the noon and sunrise seasonal
f layer anomalies

experimental determination of the energy distribution of thermoelectron
beams  an investigation using the lenard retarding field method is
reported  this method gave results accurate to within for electron
energies in the range  results indicate that a maxwell distribution
occurs only at low beam currents and densities  no direct dependence
was found on cathode temperature space charge at the cathode or control
potential a depence was observed on current density and to a lesser
degree on current intensity  deviations from maxwells distribution
could not be attributed to errors in calculation collisions with
the residual gas spectrometer effect of the emitter transverse resistances
of cathode or local anomalies of the work function positive results
were obtained by relating the electron energy distribution to longitudinal
space charge oscillations produced by the shot effect  shifts
of the energy distribution are due to changes in the work function

an analysis of bursts of solar radio emission and their association
with solar and terrestrial phenomena  solar radio emission records
on seven frequencies in the range were studied over a period of months
the analysis which includes a number of histograms shows that many
of the properties of bursts change with frequency  a study of the
time delay between bursts on different frequencies revealed that
bursts often occur first a simultaneous up and down movement of ionized
material from the level of zero refractive index at that frequency
is postulated  it is found that bursts were more frequent than flares
fadeouts and crochets and that they almost always accompanied these
effects  the commencement of bursts appears to be simultaneous with
that of flares and crochets but precedes that of fadeouts by about
two minutes  in addition there is a rough correlation between the
intensity of bursts flares fadeouts and crochets

ionization produced by photo ionization of atomic nitrogen lies between
depending on the model considered  the concentration of atomic nitrogen

a consideration of the electron disappearance in the layer of the
ionosphere  factors influencing the electron concentration and conventional
theories of recombination and attachment are reviewed  nocturnal
diffusion can account for only a small variation of concentration
but its effect on the altitude of maximum concentration is not necessarily
negligible  statistical analysis indicates that the influence
of pressure on the nocturnal variation of electron concentration
is unexpectedly small while that of temperature is large analysis
of the monthly mean values indicates that attachment rather than
recombination is the mechanism responsible for the electron disappearance
the influence of layer movements though not large is significant
further evidence in favour of the attachment theory is obtained from consideration
of distribution and from a comparison of the nocturnal
concentration variations at two sites  theoretical considerations
favour a process of electron removal in which collisions between
atomic ions of oxygen and excited molecules of nitrogen produce molecular
ions of nitrogen which in turn recombine with electrons

on the earth storms  some of the problems to be considered in studies
of storms in the upper atmosphere and outer space of the earth are
outlined  stability of solar corpuscular stream  collision with the
interplanetary plasma causes the nonmagnetized stream to lose electrons
the resulting space charge is neutralized by the change in density
of the interplanetary plasma and the stream remains stable  interaction
between the solar corpuscular stream and the ezrths magnetic field
the heating of exospheric gas caused by the compression of the magnetic
field during the initial phase of a storm is not sufficient to account
for the main phase  the main phase might however result from the
penetration of particles under the influence of a fluctuating magnetic
field  polar magnetic storms with special reference to relation between
